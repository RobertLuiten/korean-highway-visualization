## Korean Highway 2011 Visualization

This project is based on [this 2011 Korean Highways dataset](https://github.com/kaist-comet/KoreanExpressway/tree/master). Have fun!

# How To Run

After installing all the dependencies on your local machine, it's time to start up the Neo4j sever! Navigate to ```public/HIGHWAY_SERVER/bin``` and in terminal run ```./neo4j console```.

After this, navigate to the root folder and run ```npm start```. From here, you should be able to mess with the program at ```http://localhost:3000/```. Happy planning!

This simple demo was completed for a research project I am working on.
